= Ruby/Rails/Web related gedit/gtksourceview language definitions.

Part of {RubyBuntuGedit}[https://github.com/janlelis/rubybuntu-gedit]

== Features
Contains various language specs needed by Ruby/Rails/Web developers and also tries to maintain them.

* The Ruby language specification has been improved alot. It uses 1.9.2 as reference implementation, recognizes many Ruby-specific language constructs (that can be highlighted differently) and implements many language details. To see all these changes, you need a style that supports ("uses") the new specification, for example, {these styles}[https://github.com/janlelis/rubybuntu-editor-styles]. See below for a changelog summary.
* ERB is not only usable with HTML, but also with JavaScript, YAML and XML...
* Gemfile.lock highlighting

== Setup

You should also use up-to-date {mime types}[https://github.com/janlelis/rubybuntu-mime].

=== as root

    sudo cp *.lang /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs
    # you can also delete the rhtml.lang (now done via html-erb)
    sudo rm -f /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/rhtml.lang
    # and the ruby_on_rails.lang (except you want to have rails highlighting with an extra language..)
    sudo rm -f /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/ruby_on_rails.lang

=== as non-root

    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs
    cp *.lang ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs
    # you can also delete the rhtml.lang (now done via html-erb)
    rm -f ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/rhtml.lang
    # and the ruby_on_rails.lang (except you want to have rails highlighting with an extra language..)
    rm -f ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/ruby_on_rails.lang


== CHANGES
=== ruby.lang
* Uses 1.9 as reference implementation
* No Rails keywords, no extra language for Rails
* Refactored/updated keyword and builtin detection, highlight important constants and methods
* Improved function definition highlighting
* More logical style mappings (which also means: current styles are not fully ruby:compatible)
* Fix string interpolations
* Better support for advanced literals (e.g. `%x[]`, `%r<>`, ...)
* Support Arrays & Hashes (inclusive 1.9 symbol syntax)
* Different heredoc matching
* Better symbol detection
* Small language details, like recognizing `__END__`
* Better unicode support
* See `git log` for full details
* Based on https://github.com/gmate/gmate/blob/master/lang-specs/ruby_on_rails.lang

== TODO
=== ruby.lang - Advanced TODOs (or: build a "real" parser)
* Improve heredocs (e.g. nested ones)
* Different colorizations for "end"s (e.g. def/begin, class/module, while/until, if/case, block), needs to detect modifier statements correctly
* Detect (multi-line) yard doc tag values
* Add escapable char for generic string delimiters
* Advanced regex highlighting (maybe there is already something for pcre out there?)
* ruby.lang-extras/known-bugs.rb

=== Languages to add/import/update
* SASS / SCSS / CSS
* COFFEE
* HAML
* SLIM
* YAML
* CUCUMBER

Meanwhile, you can, for example, use the ones found in gmate[https://github.com/gmate/gmate/tree/master/lang-specs]

=== MAYBE
* RDOC markup support (and cross-referencing in ruby)
